# Developers Against Humanity

Developers Against Humanity: an online card game for terrible developers and system administrators.

## Language

Idk, Node.js, PHP, C#, C++?

## Dependencies

Hell if I know.

## Main Objective

Make a multi-player Cards Against Humanity game with a custom deck of cards (in JSON form) with support for:

- Different decks
- Multiple "rooms" and the ability to give those rooms custom names
- A way to track points
- Maybe some spiffy animations
- Easy installation to an Apache or Nginx web server (so, no funky ports)
